Introduction

Weed management is crucial for modern agriculture due to the ability of unregulated weed infestations to significantly reduce crop yields. Traditional weed control methods rely on manual labor and widespread herbicide application, which are time-consuming and environmentally harmful. Most existing approaches focus on identifying and categorizing weeds but overlook their spatiotemporal growth patterns. This project addresses that gap by integrating weed segmentation with time-series growth prediction, enabling farmers to make data-driven decisions for more effective weed management. Using the Moving Fields Weed Dataset (MFWD) and supplementary data sources, we will develop a hybrid model that can distinguish weed species and forecast their growth stages, providing valuable insights for targetedÂ intervention.
